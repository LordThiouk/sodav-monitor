End-to-End (E2E) Tests for SODAV Monitor System

This module implements comprehensive end-to-end tests for the SODAV Monitor system,
following the E2E testing rules to ensure accurate music detection, data integrity,
and system performance under real conditions.

The tests use actual Senegalese radio streams to verify the system's ability to:
1. Capture and process live audio streams
2. Detect music and distinguish it from speech
3. Identify tracks when possible or handle no-match scenarios gracefully
4. Store detection data correctly in the database
5. Generate accurate reports based on detection data

These tests prioritize real-world scenarios over simulated data, ensuring the system
functions as expected in production environments with actual broadcast content.
