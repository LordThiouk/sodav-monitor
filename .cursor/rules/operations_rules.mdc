### Operations Guidelines

1. Server Monitoring
- Continuous log monitoring
- Monitor critical metrics:
  - Detection success rate
  - API response times
  - Server resource usage
  - Database performance

2. API Standards
- All endpoints must return valid responses (200 OK)
- Standardized error responses:
  - Clear error messages
  - Appropriate status codes
  - Detailed error context
- Rate limiting implementation
- Request validation

3. Database Operations
- Validate migrations before deployment
- Maintain database indexes
- Regular backup schedule
- Performance optimization

4. Real-time Processing
- Track all detections with:
  - Accurate timestamps (detected_at)
  - Duration measurement (play_duration)
  - Station identification
  - Track metadata

5. Security Measures
- API authentication
- Input validation
- XSS protection
- CORS configuration
- Rate limiting
