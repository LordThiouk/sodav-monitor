### Testing Guidelines

1. Test Organization
- All tests must be in backend/tests/
- Follow naming convention: test_<function_name>.py
- Group tests by component/functionality
- Maintain clear test hierarchy

2. Testing Framework
- Use pytest as primary framework
- Required plugins:
  - pytest-cov for coverage
  - pytest-asyncio for async tests
  - pytest-mock for mocking

3. Coverage Requirements
- Minimum 90% code coverage
- Critical paths require 100% coverage:
  - Detection pipeline
  - Authentication
  - Data persistence
  - API endpoints

4. Testing Approach
- Unit Tests:
  - Test individual components
  - Use mocks for external services
  - Validate edge cases
- Integration Tests:
  - Test component interactions
  - Validate full detection pipeline
  - Test database operations
- End-to-End Tests:
  - Test complete workflows
  - Validate system integration

5. Test Documentation
- Update docs/tests after changes
- Document test scenarios
- Maintain TESTING_STRATEGY.md
- Include example test data

6. Test Data Management
- Use fixtures for common data
- Maintain separate test database
- Clean up test data after runs
- Version control test assets
