### Code Style Guidelines

1. File Naming Conventions
- Use snake_case for all file names
- Files should be named descriptively based on their primary function
- Test files must follow pattern: test_<function_name>.py

2. File Size and Organization
- Maximum file size: 500 lines
- Split files exceeding limit into logical modules
- Group related functionality into appropriate directories
- Move deprecated code to /legacy/ instead of deletion

3. Code Organization
- Group related functions and classes together
- Keep one class/main function per file
- Maintain clear separation of concerns
- Use appropriate design patterns

4. Code Formatting
- Follow PEP 8 for Python code
- Use TypeScript strict mode for frontend
- Consistent indentation (4 spaces for Python, 2 spaces for TypeScript/JavaScript)
- Clear spacing between functions and classes
