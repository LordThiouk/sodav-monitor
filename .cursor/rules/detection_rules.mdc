### Detection Process Guidelines

1. Content Type Analysis
- Analyze incoming audio streams to identify content type:
  - Music → Proceed with detection pipeline
  - Speech → Skip detection, record metadata only
- API endpoint: /api/channels/detect-music

2. Detection Pipeline Order
a. Local Detection (Primary)
   - Query local database with fingerprints
   - Proceed if match found
   - Record detection data

b. MusicBrainz Detection (Secondary)
   - Query if local detection fails
   - Use ACOUSTID_API_KEY (distinct from AUDD)
   - Store metadata if found

c. Audd Detection (Fallback)
   - Last resort option
   - Use AUDD_API_KEY
   - Store any successful matches

3. Required Detection Data
- Fingerprint Information:
  - fingerprint: Processed audio fingerprint
  - fingerprint_raw: Raw fingerprint data
- Timing Data:
  - detected_at: Timestamp of detection
  - play_duration: Track play duration
  - station_id: Broadcasting station
- Confidence Metrics:
  - confidence_score: Detection confidence level
  - detection_method: Which detection service succeeded

4. Error Handling
- Log failed detections with timestamps
- Record failed attempts for analysis
- Implement retry mechanism for network failures
- Maintain error statistics per detection method
