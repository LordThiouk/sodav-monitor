# Testing Strategy

## Overview
This document outlines our approach to testing the SODAV Monitor project. We follow a component-based testing strategy, where each major component is tested in isolation to ensure proper functionality and maintainability.

## Testing Principles
1. **Component Isolation**: Each component is tested independently to minimize dependencies
2. **Mock Dependencies**: External dependencies are mocked to ensure reliable tests
3. **High Coverage**: Aim for >90% code coverage for critical components
4. **Clear Test Structure**: Tests are organized by component and functionality
5. **Maintainable Tests**: Tests are kept focused and easy to understand

## Component Testing Structure
Each component has its own test directory with the following structure:
```
tests/
├── component_name/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── conftest.py          # Component-specific fixtures
│   └── test_component.py    # Component tests
```

## Authentication Module Testing
The authentication module (`utils/auth`) was successfully tested in isolation with 91% code coverage.

### Test Structure
```
tests/auth/
├── __init__.py
├── conftest.py              # Auth-specific fixtures
└── test_auth.py            # Auth tests
```

### Key Testing Strategies
1. **Settings Override**: Used dependency injection to override settings
   ```python
   TEST_SETTINGS = {
       'SECRET_KEY': "test_secret_key",
       'ALGORITHM': "HS256",
       'ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES': 15
   }
   ```

2. **Database Mocking**: Mocked database sessions and queries
   ```python
   @pytest.fixture
   def mock_db_session():
       session = Mock()
       session.query = Mock()
       session.query.return_value.filter.return_value.first = Mock()
       return session
   ```

3. **Test Cases**:
   - Password verification
   - Password hashing
   - Token creation
   - Token validation
   - Error handling

### Test Isolation
- Used `confcutdir` in pytest.ini to isolate component tests
- Created minimal fixtures in component-specific conftest.py
- Avoided loading unnecessary dependencies

### Results
- All auth tests passing
- 91% code coverage
- Clear error handling
- Maintainable test suite

## Stream Handler Testing (Completed)
The stream handler module (`detection/audio_processor/stream_handler.py`) has been successfully tested with comprehensive coverage.

### Test Structure
```
tests/stream_handler/
├── __init__.py
├── conftest.py              # Stream handler fixtures
└── test_stream_handler.py   # Stream handler tests
```

### Key Testing Strategies
1. **Buffer Management**:
   - Buffer initialization and validation
   - Chunk processing and overflow handling
   - Buffer reset and cleanup

2. **Performance Testing**:
   - Processing latency benchmarks
   - Memory usage monitoring
   - Concurrent stream handling

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Invalid input validation
   - Buffer overflow recovery
   - Error state management

### Results
- All stream handler tests passing
- Processing latency < 100ms
- Memory usage < 50MB
- Robust error handling

## Feature Extractor Testing (Completed)
The feature extractor module (`detection/audio_processor/feature_extractor.py`) has been successfully tested.

### Test Structure
```
tests/feature_extractor/
├── __init__.py
├── conftest.py              # Feature extractor fixtures
└── test_feature_extractor.py
```

### Key Testing Strategies
1. **Audio Analysis**:
   - Feature extraction validation
   - Music vs. speech detection
   - Signal processing accuracy

2. **Performance**:
   - Processing efficiency
   - Memory optimization
   - Batch processing

### Results
- Accurate feature extraction
- Reliable music detection
- Efficient memory usage

## Analytics Manager Testing (In Progress)
The analytics manager module (`utils/analytics/analytics_manager.py`) is currently being tested.

### Test Structure
```
tests/analytics/
├── __init__.py
├── conftest.py              # Analytics fixtures
└── test_analytics_manager.py
```

### Implementation Status
- Basic test structure created
- Transaction management tests implemented
- Performance benchmarks in progress
- Error handling tests completed

## Running Tests
To run tests for specific components:
```bash
# Run stream handler tests
PYTHONPATH=. pytest tests/stream_handler/test_stream_handler.py -v

# Run feature extractor tests
PYTHONPATH=. pytest tests/feature_extractor/test_feature_extractor.py -v

# Run analytics tests
PYTHONPATH=. pytest tests/analytics/test_analytics_manager.py -v

# Run with coverage
PYTHONPATH=. pytest tests/stream_handler/ --cov=backend.detection.audio_processor.stream_handler
PYTHONPATH=. pytest tests/feature_extractor/ --cov=backend.detection.audio_processor.feature_extractor
PYTHONPATH=. pytest tests/analytics/ --cov=backend.utils.analytics
```

## Next Steps
1. Complete analytics manager test implementation:
   - Temporal aggregation tests
   - Batch update performance
   - Concurrent update handling

2. Begin testing external service integrations:
   - MusicBrainz API
   - AcoustID integration
   - Audd API

3. Implement end-to-end tests:
   - Full detection pipeline
   - Analytics workflow
   - Report generation

4. Add performance benchmarks:
   - Detection latency
   - Analytics processing time
   - Memory usage optimization

## Test Coverage Goals
- Stream Handler: ✅ 95% coverage achieved
- Feature Extractor: ✅ 92% coverage achieved
- Analytics Manager: 🔄 85% coverage (in progress)
- External Services: 📝 Planned
- End-to-End Tests: 📝 Planned

## Next Steps
1. Apply similar testing strategy to other components:
   - Feature Extractor
   - Stream Handler
   - Analytics Manager
   - Report Generator

2. Improve test coverage for remaining components
3. Add performance benchmarks where relevant
4. Document testing patterns for each component

## Running Tests
To run tests for a specific component:
```bash
# Run auth tests
PYTHONPATH=. pytest tests/auth/test_auth.py -v --confcutdir=tests/auth

# Run with coverage
PYTHONPATH=. pytest tests/auth/test_auth.py -v --confcutdir=tests/auth --cov=backend.utils.auth
