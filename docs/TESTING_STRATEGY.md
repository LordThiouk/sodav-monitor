# Testing Strategy

## Overview
This document outlines our approach to testing the SODAV Monitor project. We follow a component-based testing strategy, where each major component is tested in isolation to ensure proper functionality and maintainability.

## Testing Principles
1. **Component Isolation**: Each component is tested independently to minimize dependencies
2. **Mock Dependencies**: External dependencies are mocked to ensure reliable tests
3. **High Coverage**: Aim for >90% code coverage for critical components
4. **Clear Test Structure**: Tests are organized by component and functionality
5. **Maintainable Tests**: Tests are kept focused and easy to understand
6. **Real-World Scenarios**: Include tests with realistic audio samples and use cases

## Component Testing Structure
Each component has its own test directory with the following structure:
```
tests/
â”œâ”€â”€ component_name/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ conftest.py          # Component-specific fixtures
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ test_component.py    # Component tests
```

## Audio Processing Components

### Test Categories
1. **Basic Functionality**
   - Audio data processing
   - Feature extraction
   - Music/speech classification
   - Error handling

2. **Performance Testing**

   - Multiple instruments
   - Various sample rates
   - Different audio formats

### Test Data Generation
1. **Synthetic Audio**
   - Pure sine waves
   - Complex harmonics
   - White noise
   - Amplitude modulation

2. **Real Audio Samples**
   - Music recordings
   - Speech recordings
   - Mixed content
   - Radio broadcasts

### Performance Benchmarks
1. **Latency Requirements**
   - Audio processing: < 10ms
   - Feature extraction: < 100ms
   - Music detection: < 50ms

2. **Resource Usage Limits**
   - Memory growth: < 50MB
   - CPU usage: < 80%
   - Concurrent streams: 5+

### Test Implementation Guidelines
1. **Mock External Services**
   - Audio libraries (librosa)
   - File system operations
   - Network requests

2. **Use Appropriate Fixtures**
   - Audio data generators
   - Sample rate converters
   - Feature extractors

## Authentication Module Testing
The authentication module (`utils/auth`) was successfully tested in isolation with 91% code coverage.

### Test Structure
```
tests/auth/
â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
â”œâ”€â”€ conftest.py              # Auth-specific fixtures
â””â”€â”€ test_auth.py            # Auth tests
```

### Key Testing Strategies
1. **Settings Override**: Used dependency injection to override settings
   ```python
   TEST_SETTINGS = {
       'SECRET_KEY': "test_secret_key",
       'ALGORITHM': "HS256",
       'ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES': 15
   }
   ```

2. **Database Mocking**: Mocked database sessions and queries
   ```python
   @pytest.fixture
   def mock_db_session():
       session = Mock()
       session.query = Mock()
       session.query.return_value.filter.return_value.first = Mock()
       return session
   ```

3. **Test Cases**:
   - Password verification
   - Password hashing
   - Token creation
   - Token validation
   - Error handling

### Test Isolation
- Used `confcutdir` in pytest.ini to isolate component tests
- Created minimal fixtures in component-specific conftest.py
- Avoided loading unnecessary dependencies

### Results
- All auth tests passing
- 91% code coverage
- Clear error handling
- Maintainable test suite

## Feature Extractor Testing (Completed)

### Test Structure
```
tests/feature_extractor/
â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
â”œâ”€â”€ conftest.py              # Feature extractor fixtures
â””â”€â”€ test_feature_extractor.py
```
