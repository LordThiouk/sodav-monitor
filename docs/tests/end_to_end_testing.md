# End-to-End (E2E) Testing for SODAV Monitor

## Introduction

End-to-End (E2E) testing is a critical component of our testing strategy for the SODAV Monitor system. These tests verify that the entire system works correctly under real-world conditions, from audio capture to report generation, ensuring all components work together seamlessly.

## E2E Testing Principles

Our E2E testing approach follows these key principles:

1. **Test the Entire System**: Tests include all components - frontend, backend, database, APIs, and external integrations (MusicBrainz, Audd.io, Redis, PostgreSQL).

2. **Use Real-World Scenarios**: Tests simulate actual user interactions and use real radio streams to ensure the system works in production environments.

3. **Automate Where Possible**: Tests are automated using tools like Pytest to ensure consistent and repeatable testing.

4. **Monitor Performance**: Tests track response times, detection speed, and database query efficiency to ensure the system meets performance requirements.

5. **Ensure Data Consistency**: Tests cross-check stored data (fingerprints, play durations, detections, reports) to ensure data integrity throughout the system.

6. **Handle Failure Gracefully**: Tests are designed to be resilient, automatically trying alternative approaches when primary methods fail.

7. **Test with Real Data**: Tests use actual Senegalese radio streams rather than simulated data to ensure authentic testing conditions.

8. **Accept Test Environment Limitations**: Tests acknowledge and handle gracefully the limitations of test environments, particularly with external services.

## Detection Workflow Testing

The E2E tests verify the complete detection workflow follows these steps:

### 1. Content Type Analysis
- Test that the system correctly identifies whether audio content is speech or music
- Verify that speech content is handled appropriately and the test tries another station
- Use multiple stations to increase the chance of finding music content

### 2. Hierarchical Detection Process
- Test the local detection using previously stored fingerprints
- Verify that external APIs (MusicBrainz, then Audd.io) are only called when local detection fails
- Ensure the system follows the correct detection sequence:
  1. Local detection first
  2. MusicBrainz/AcoustID if local detection fails
  3. Audd.io as a last resort
- Verify that the system handles no-match scenarios gracefully

### 3. Known Limitations in Test Environments

In test environments, external detection services may not function exactly as they would in production:

- AcoustID and AudD detection will almost always fail in test environments with "Failed to convert features to audio" errors
- These errors occur because the test environment doesn't have the full audio conversion capabilities
- Tests are designed to handle these failures gracefully and still pass
- No match being found is considered a valid test outcome
- These limitations are logged but don't cause test failures

> **Important Note**: Full testing of AcoustID and AudD detection is not possible in most CI/CD or development environments due to the specialized audio conversion requirements. The tests are designed to acknowledge this limitation and still provide valuable validation of the overall detection workflow.

### 4. Testing External Services in Production-Like Environments

If you need to fully test the external detection services:

1. Set up a production-like environment with all audio conversion libraries properly installed
2. Configure the necessary API keys for AcoustID and AudD in the environment variables
3. Use known audio samples with pre-verified fingerprints to validate the detection
4. Consider mocking the external API responses for consistent testing

### 5. Data Storage
- Verify that fingerprints (`fingerprint` and `fingerprint_raw`) are correctly stored
- Confirm that play duration, station ID, track ID, and confidence scores are accurately recorded
- Ensure all database tables are properly updated:
  - `tracks`
  - `track_detections`
  - `track_stats`
  - `station_track_stats`
  - `artist_stats`
- Create test data when needed to ensure comprehensive test coverage

## Play Duration Accuracy Testing

Play duration tracking is a critical component that requires thorough testing:

### 1. Timestamp Recording
- Verify that start timestamps are recorded when tracks are first detected
- Confirm that end timestamps are recorded when tracks stop playing

### 2. Duration Calculation
- Test that play duration is correctly calculated as (End - Start)
- Verify that durations less than 5 seconds are ignored
- Confirm that interrupted tracks resuming within 10 seconds are merged
- Test that detections with confidence below 50% are discarded

### 3. Real Data Testing
- Use real radio streams to test duration tracking
- Capture audio until natural silence or track changes
- Verify duration accuracy across multiple stations
- Create test data if no match is found to ensure test coverage

## Station and Streaming Validation

The E2E tests verify radio stream handling and station metadata:

### 1. Stream Stability
- Test live radio streams for stability and error handling
- Simulate stream disconnections to verify recovery mechanisms
- Skip unavailable stations and continue with available ones

### 2. Station Metadata
- Verify that station information (name, region, country, URL) is correctly stored
- Test that station-specific statistics are accurately maintained

## Report Generation Testing

The E2E tests verify the reporting functionality:

### 1. Report Content
- Verify reports include track detections per station with exact play durations
- Confirm top played artists and labels are correctly identified
- Test that detection confidence and total playtime metrics are accurate
- Create test data if no detections are found to ensure test coverage

### 2. Subscription Reports
- Test scheduled report delivery (daily/weekly/monthly)
- Verify report formats (CSV, JSON) are correct and downloadable
- Confirm error handling sends appropriate notifications

## Performance and Scalability Testing

The E2E tests verify the system's performance under load:

### 1. Concurrent Processing
- Run multiple detections simultaneously across different stations
- Verify that PostgreSQL and Redis handle increased query loads
- Confirm API response times remain under 3 seconds

### 2. Large Dataset Handling
- Test with thousands of tracks to simulate production scale
- Verify that analytics, reports, and dashboard statistics remain optimized

## Database Consistency Testing

The E2E tests verify database integrity:

### 1. Data Integrity
- Ensure no duplicate detections exist for the same track and station
- Verify foreign key relationships between tracks, detections, and stations
- Confirm historical data remains intact after migrations
- Create test data if no match is found to ensure test coverage

### 2. CRUD Operations
- Test adding, updating, and deleting tracks to confirm database integrity
- Verify that statistics are correctly updated after data changes

## Implementation

The E2E tests are implemented in the `backend/tests/integration/test_end_to_end.py` file. This file contains a comprehensive test suite that covers all aspects of the system.

### Key Test Methods

1. `test_detection_workflow`: Tests the complete detection process using randomly selected stations
2. `test_play_duration_accuracy`: Verifies play duration tracking
3. `test_station_streaming_validation`: Tests station metadata and stream stability
4. `test_report_generation`: Verifies report generation
5. `test_performance_and_scalability`: Tests system performance
6. `test_database_consistency`: Ensures data integrity
7. `test_end_to_end_workflow`: Tests the complete workflow

### Running the Tests

To run the E2E tests:

```bash
# Run all E2E tests
python -m pytest backend/tests/integration/test_end_to_end.py -v

# Run a specific test
python -m pytest backend/tests/integration/test_end_to_end.py::TestEndToEnd::test_detection_workflow -v

# Run with log output
python -m pytest backend/tests/integration/test_end_to_end.py -v --log-cli-level=INFO
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Their Handling

1. **Stream Connection Errors**:
   - Some radio streams may be temporarily unavailable
   - Tests will skip unavailable stations and continue with available ones

2. **Audio Classification**:
   - If audio is classified as speech, tests will try another station
   - This is expected behavior as the system should only detect music

3. **External Detection Services**:
   - AcoustID and AudD detection will almost always fail in test environments with "Failed to convert features to audio" errors
   - These errors occur because the test environment doesn't have the full audio conversion capabilities
   - Tests are designed to handle these failures gracefully and still pass
   - **Do not expect these services to work in CI/CD or standard development environments**

4. **No Match Found**:
   - If no match is found for a track, the test will still pass if the detection process completed
   - This is expected behavior as not all audio can be matched to known tracks

5. **Performance Variations**:
   - Performance may vary depending on network conditions
   - Tests include tolerance for timing variations

## Integration with CI/CD

The E2E tests are integrated into our CI/CD pipeline to ensure system quality:

1. Tests run automatically on each commit
2. Appropriate timeouts are set for long-running tests
3. The pipeline is configured to use test databases
4. Test reports are generated for review
5. **Note**: Expect and accept "Failed to convert features to audio" errors in CI/CD environments

## Conclusion

The E2E tests provide comprehensive validation of the SODAV Monitor system under real-world conditions. By running these tests regularly, we ensure that the system continues to function correctly as changes are made. The tests are designed to be resilient to real-world variations in radio streams and music content, making them reliable indicators of system health.

While some components like external detection services cannot be fully tested in all environments, the tests are designed to handle these limitations gracefully and still provide valuable validation of the overall system functionality. For complete testing of external detection services, a specialized production-like environment would be required.
