# Code Style Fixes

This document outlines the code style fixes that have been implemented to ensure consistency and maintainability across the SODAV Monitor codebase.

## Overview

We've implemented several code style improvements to ensure the codebase adheres to PEP 8 standards and passes all pre-commit checks. These improvements include:

- Removing unused imports
- Fixing docstring formatting
- Addressing line length issues
- Removing trailing whitespace
- Ensuring proper indentation

## Tools Used

The following tools are used to enforce code style:

- **Black**: Code formatter that ensures consistent code style
- **Flake8**: Linter that checks for PEP 8 compliance and other issues
- **isort**: Tool for sorting imports alphabetically and separating them into sections
- **pre-commit**: Framework for managing and maintaining pre-commit hooks

## Recent Fixes

### Backend Utils

#### validators.py
- Fixed trailing whitespace in blank lines
- Broke long regex pattern into multiple lines to adhere to line length limits
- Ensured consistent docstring formatting

#### analytics_manager.py
- Removed unused imports
- Added proper module and class docstrings
- Fixed line length issues by restructuring SQL queries
- Improved code readability by breaking long lines

#### check_durations.py
- Fixed comparison to None using SQLAlchemy's `is_(None)` and `isnot(None)`
- Enhanced docstrings for clarity
- Improved error handling and logging

### Test Files

#### test_websocket.py
- Fixed undefined names by importing the correct functions and classes
- Removed unused imports
- Ensured all test functions use the correct imported functions

## Running Pre-commit Checks

To ensure your code adheres to our style guidelines, run pre-commit checks before committing:

```bash
# Install pre-commit
pip install pre-commit

# Install the pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install

# Run pre-commit on all files
pre-commit run --all-files

# Run pre-commit on specific files
pre-commit run --files path/to/file.py
```

## Best Practices

1. **Keep lines under 100 characters**: Break long lines into multiple lines for better readability.
2. **Use proper docstrings**: Follow the Google docstring format for all functions, classes, and methods.
3. **Remove unused imports**: Keep imports clean and only include what's necessary.
4. **Use consistent naming**: Follow snake_case for variables and functions, CamelCase for classes.
5. **Organize imports**: Use isort to organize imports into standard library, third-party, and local imports.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Trailing Whitespace
Use the pre-commit hook to automatically fix trailing whitespace:
```bash
pre-commit run trailing-whitespace --files path/to/file.py
```

### Line Length Issues
Break long lines into multiple lines, especially for:
- Long strings (use parentheses)
- SQL queries (assign to variables or break into multiple lines)
- Function calls with many arguments

### Docstring Formatting
Ensure docstrings follow this format:
```python
def function_name(param1, param2):
    """Short description of the function.

    More detailed description if needed.

    Args:
        param1: Description of param1
        param2: Description of param2

    Returns:
        Description of return value
    """
```

## Conclusion

Maintaining consistent code style is essential for collaboration and code maintainability. By following these guidelines and using the provided tools, we can ensure that the SODAV Monitor codebase remains clean, readable, and maintainable.
